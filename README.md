# QuestionList

This repository will store and label every question I have used as the Judge Advisor for VEX Robotics Competitions. The reason I am doing this is to even the playing field. Since I am the Judge Advisor for many competitions, teams who are interviewed at many of my competitions will become more adjusted to the questions I ask, since it is unrealistic for me to develop an entirely new set of questions every single competition. This repository aims to even the playing field.

On a secondary level, this repository also serves as a resource for judges to develop their own set of questions.
